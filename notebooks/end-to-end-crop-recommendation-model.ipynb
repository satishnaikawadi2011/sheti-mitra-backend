    "# Recommending A Crop Using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will introduce some foundation machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of crop recommendation **classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another (**single-class classification**). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as **multi-class classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we'll end up with\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we already have a dataset, we'll approach the problem by keeping the following topics in our mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** - the process of going through a dataset and finding out more about it.\n",
    "* **Model training** - create model(s) to learn to predict a target variable based on other variables.\n",
    "* **Model evaluation** - evaluating a models predictions using problem-specific evaluation metrics. \n",
    "* **Model comparison** - comparing several different models to find the best one.\n",
    "* **Model fine-tuning** - once we've found a good model, how can we improve it?\n",
    "* **Feature importance** - since we're recommending a crop, are there some things which are more important for prediction?\n",
    "* **Cross-validation** - if we do build a good model, can we be sure it will work on unseen data?\n",
    "* **Reporting what we've found** - if we had to present our work, what would we show someone?\n",
    "\n",
    "To work through these topics, we'll use pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy for data anaylsis, as well as, Scikit-Learn for machine learning and modelling tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work through each step and by the end of the notebook, we'll have a handful of models, all which can predict whether or not a person has heart disease based on a number of different parameters at a considerable accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also describe which parameters are more indicative than others, for example, rainfall may be more important than temperature."
